If you want to impress your dinner guests for your next cocktail party, just remove the worst performing stocks from your stocklist and replace them with some thoroughbreds picked up from the latest trading blogs...

You may sport a trading system with a success rate above 75% if you try.

Nothing dishonest with that - but the problem is there is no guarantee your stocklist will perform as well next year as it did last year. With the power of hindsight you can always pick the best last performers with technical analysis tools but that does not predict the future.
